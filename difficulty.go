// difficulty.go — LWMA-3 difficulty retarget and fork-version helpers for Chakram.
// Uses Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA-3) giving more weight to recent
// blocks. Adopted by low-hashrate networks (Zcash, Beam) to resist timestamp
// manipulation and hash-rate volatility.
package main

// NextDifficulty returns the proof-of-work difficulty for the block at height.
// Called by the miner and must produce identical results on every node.
//
// Algorithm (LWMA-3):
//   - For the first DifficultyWindow blocks return InitialDifficulty so the
//     chain starts at a sensible rate without a calibration period.
//   - Fetch the last DifficultyWindow+1 blocks to derive N solve times.
//   - Assign linearly increasing weights (oldest=1, newest=N) so recent blocks
//     influence the estimate more than old ones.
//   - Clamp each solve time to [1, 6×TargetBlockTime] to limit the damage a
//     manipulated timestamp can do to a single sample.
//   - Adjust current difficulty by TargetBlockTime / weighted_avg.
//   - Cap increases at 4× per window (prevents runaway escalation from a
//     sudden hashrate spike). No downward cap: if difficulty overshoots and
//     blocks slow down, the chain self-corrects in a single adjustment rather
//     than being permanently stuck.
//   - Result never falls below MinDifficulty.
